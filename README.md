## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to center a div and how to align items.

i learnt the importance of flexbox.

i also learnt how to make a repository on Github, prior to this project i never knew how to use Github but now i have been able to learn a little about it and how to use it.

i learnt how to deploy my codes on vercel app which is exciting.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

There are a few areas i look forward to continue focusing which include:

1) the use of git and github
2) hosting of web apps etc
